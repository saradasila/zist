# ZIST

Short messaging service with optional secret messaging.

Based on AngularJS and Firebase

## Keys

ZIST depends on Firebase. You need a Firebase token to succesfully use this app.

Create a app at firebase.google.com, add the keys to `src/environments/environment.secrets.ts`. `src/environments/environment.secrets.ts` is provided as an example.  

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
